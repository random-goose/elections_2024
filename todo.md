# Bugs
- ✅ two flask files - both have neccessary things? - same port
    merge

    use similar viz code as the one youre gonna make for fake news

# PRIORITY
- community graphs
    quora
        ask akshit where is the code to generate graphml files for each date (100_1, 100_2, etc)
    sharechat
        where is the data?
        remember that the sharechat data should have same keywords as that of quora

- Inference
    - Ramanjunam Server 

# Pending

- ✅  Toxic Memes - updated architecture diagram from Rahul's new submission

- ✅ Add a function to output smth sample whenever recieving andy data
    - ✅ framing
    - ✅ a sample email to the user when they upload to fake news
        username pass changing? - electiondashboard1@gmail.com , RithwiksProject

- ✅ the backend function for image uploads: it expects the path of the image 
    Add a function to handle uploads, and give the appropriate path to the function

- Fake News
    ✅ instead of confusion matrix, we need a graph wehre the X asis is the date, and Y is frequency of fake news
    inference scripts are on the ramanujam server
        which ever inference script is working 
        write the steps to run the scripts
        a new person (who has the credentials to login into ramanujam server)
        should be able to follow the instructions and run the inference script

- ✅ restructure repo 
    - ✅ remove redunanant graph folder: move ghraphxml files to community and change the code in backend appjs line 34

- framing 
    ✅ from where data file is being fetched?
    upload data
        a) big data
        b) small data (for visualization)

- ✅ refer to the video with sushant and bhupathi to determien framing model and inference scripts
    video link is on whatsapp

- ✅ do ask harsha if the model is the latest one or not
    because older model was about game, attack, misc frame
    we later changed it to attack and misc frames
